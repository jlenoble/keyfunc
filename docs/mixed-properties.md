### Mixed properties !heading

With [`property:*`](#property), just like for [`array:* and set:*`](#array-and-set), your properties point to base types like 'object' or 'array'. That is an improvement compared to default 'literal', but you will often want more flexibility and generate keys for arbitrary types.

Just like for 'array', you can use the option 'sub' for that.
